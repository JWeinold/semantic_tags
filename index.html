  Cannon Beach, near Tolovana Park. This igneous rock has an elevation of 235 feet (72 m) and is often
  accessible at low tide, especially in the summertime. There is a small cave system that penetrates the
  rock and can be seen from the coastline. The rock is also protected as a marine sanctuary,

  the rock. Near Haystack Rock are the Needles, two tall rocks rising straight out of the water.</article><br>
